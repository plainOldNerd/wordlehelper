This project is only intended as a hobby project for myself!!
Anyone may use the code - I don't care - but don't blame me for anything nor 
ask me questions!

Its only real purpose is that I can use the complete word list from the NY
Times Wordle site to help me to complete the puzzle after midnight, and then 
kill the server and let my laptop sleep.

I DON'T care about quality code (although I usually do), maintainability, 
extensibilty, nor anything of the sort!
I ONLY care that it works!

It DOES ASSUME that each word has at most two of the same letter, which is
easily seen to be false!! See "abaka" and "abaya" from the wordlist file.
Clearly, these two words (along with whatever others) don't seem to be English 
and most probably will never be the correct solution.
