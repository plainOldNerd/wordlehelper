This project is only intended as a hobby project for myself!!
Anyone may use the code - I don't care - but don't blame me for anything nor 
ask me questions!

Its only real purpose is that I can use the complete word list from the NY
Times Wordle site to help me to complete the puzzle after midnight, and then 
kill the server and let my laptop sleep.

I DON'T care about quality code (although I usually do), maintainability, 
extensibilty, nor anything of the sort!
I ONLY care that it works!

It DOES ASSUME that each word has at most two of the same letter, which is
easily seen to be false!! See "abaka" and "abaya" from the wordlist file.
Clearly, these two words (along with whatever others) don't seem to be English 
and most probably will never be the correct solution.
Other words - more sensible words - seen to have three of the same letter, 
seen by the ssoa script, are
- added
- bubba
- duddy ?!
- duded ?!
- faffy ?!
- glugg
- grrrl (somebody is THAT enthusiastic about the listener being a girl?!)
- jeeze
- lolls
- lolly
- momma
- mommy
- nanna
- nonna
- can't be bother anymore. It suffices to say there's a few!

In hindsight, it was perhaps a bad assuption RE repeated letters that there
are no words with three repeated letters.
Maybe I need to rework this project...?! Shouldn't be too difficult though 
(then again, everytime a programmer says that they nearlt immediately regret
it!).
